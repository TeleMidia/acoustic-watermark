This is a Readme file for the android app project AudioChecker, its transmission and 
iterations along the development.

The purpose of the app is to recognize a message encoded on high frequencies being 
transmited on the user surroundings so it can be received by the microfone and decoded 
on the device.

All frequencies are close or above the human hearing capacity. So it is inteded to the
hard or impossible to detect without equipments the signal being broadcasted.

The latest version includes syncronization, error correction and real time threshold
adaptation for the transmission. The transmission is currently done by an amplitude 
modulation and the bit rate is 17 bps.
